          <p>I am a third year Statistics and Computing student at the University of Waterloo. Welcome to my personal website and mini blog :)<br><br>A little about me:<br>My name is Alyssa Lam and I'm originally from Mauritius, a little island in the Indian Ocean. In my free time, I like to learn more about anything related to technology. My interests revolve around Data Analytics and Web Development.

        <ul class="job">
          <h2>Analyst @ <a href="https://www.loblaw.ca/" target="_blank">Loblaw Companies Limited</a> | May 2023 - August 2023</h2>
          <p>I worked with the Loyalty Team under Discount Analytics at LCL! I undertook several tasks to support the PC Optimum Loyalty Program such as the day-to-day management and analysis for Points offers for the Discount division as well as documenting processes for my team. I really enjoyed the hybrid work model as I was able to connect and engage with my coworkers as well as have some WFH rest days :)<p>
          <br>
          <h2>Data Analyst @ <a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/" target="_blank">RBC Capital Markets</a> | September 2022 - December 2022</h2>
          <p>I worked with the Stakeholder Engagement team under Core Data Services at RBC Capital Markets. I supported the diagnosis, resolution and escalation of several data issues as well as undetook data reconciliation tasks. I went in office 1-2 times per week and it was great to commute to downtown Toronto for a change of scenery.<p>
          <br>
          <h2>Junior Business Analyst @ <a href="https://www.mcap.com/" target="_blank">MCAP</a> | January 2022 - April 2022</h2>
          <p>I worked jointly for the Documents and Servicing agile teams at MCAP. I mostly maintained and updated several automated mortgage documents on the Correspondence System using HTML. I also performed test plans and identified issues or discrepancies. I am grateful for the experience and the new skills I acquired during my first co-op term and it was insightful to learn more about the mortgage industry.<p>
          <br>
          <h2>Research Intern @ <a href="https://www.mcb.mu/en/" target="_blank">The Mauritius Commercial Bank</a> | July 2020</h2>
          <p>I worked at the Strategy and Project Office of MCB Private Banking and Wealth Management SBU. Although the internship was only 1 month, I learned a lot on the private banking sector and it enabled me to improve my MS Excel and Powerpoint skills. On a daily basis, I maintained and consolidated the list of foreign currency requests for Treasury. The SBU was working on the creation of a mobile app for their clients. Accordingly I was assigned to prepare a comparative analysis of Mobile Banking & Wealth App features of 20+ international banks. I also helped to make a little prototype of the desired app for my supervisor's powerpoint.<p>
